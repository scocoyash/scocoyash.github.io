	This will be the place where I will write about things that interest me.

	<p>Hey, Yash here! I'm currently working on On-Device Ai @ Samsung R&D, Bengaluru. 
		I'm documenting my learning notes in this blog. 
		Mostly, this will be projects, shared on <a href="https://github.com/scocoyash"> github</a>, but... who knows.
		Whenever there is a problem that takes longer time to solve, I might blog about it to help others.
		Send me an email: yashjain864@gmail.com if you have questions or find errors. Thanks :)</p>

	<p>Fun fact: I can sleep more than a Panda, if I want to :p</p>
