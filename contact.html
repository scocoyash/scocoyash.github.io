	<p>Hey, Yash here! I'm currently working in On-Device AI team @ Samsung R&D, Bengaluru. <br/>
		This will be the place where I will write about things that interest me.<br/>
		Also, will document my learning notes in this blog. 	
		<br/>Mostly, this will be projects, shared on <a href="https://github.com/scocoyash"> github</a>, but... who knows.
		<br/>Whenever there is a problem that takes longer time to solve, I might blog about it to help others.
		<br/>Send me an email: yashjain864@gmail.com if you have questions or find errors. Thanks :)</p>

	<p>Fun fact: I can sleep more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">Panda</a>, if I want to :p</p>
