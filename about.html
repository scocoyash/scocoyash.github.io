	<p>Hey, Yash here! I'm currently working in On-Device AI team @ Samsung R&D, Bengaluru. 
		<br/>This is the place where I will write about things that interest me.
		<br/>Also, I will sometimes document my learning notes in this blog. 	
		<br/>Mostly, this will be my projects, shared on <a href="https://github.com/scocoyash"> Github</a>, but... who knows.
		<br/>I will be available at <b>yashjain864@gmail.com</b>, always.</p>

	<p><u>Fun fact:</u> I can sleep more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">Panda</a>, if I want to :p</p>
